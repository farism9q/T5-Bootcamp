# <div align="center"><b>Second Week at T5 - Bootcamp</b></div>

## Overview of What I Learned:

### Day 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning

On the first day, we began with a comprehensive introduction to Machine Learning (ML). We covered the basic concepts, what is it great for, and its applications

### Day 2 - Feature Engineering

Day two was focused on feature engineering, a crucial step in the ML pipeline that involves creating input features from raw data. We delved into:

- The importance of feature engineering in improving model performance
- Techniques for creating feature
- Feature transformation with scaling and normalization
- Types of feature selection

### Day 3 - Supervised Learning: Regression

On the third day, we explored supervised learning with a focus on regression techniques. The key topics covered were:

- Definition and applications of Supervised Learning
- Types of regression: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, etc.
- Model evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared
- How to train a model

### Day 4 - Supervised Learning: Classification

The fourth day was dedicated to classification, another fundamental supervised learning technique. We learned about:

- Definition and applications of classification
- Types of classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Model evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix

### Day 5 - Project day

On the final day, we applied the concepts learned throughout the week to a real-world dataset, Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) Dataset. The primary goal was to build models that can accurately predict the severity of accidents and to identify the key factors that contribute to severe accidents. The hands-on activities included:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Feature Selection
- Modeling
- Model Evaluation
