## Overview of What I Learned:

### Day 1 - Exploring Google Colab

On the first day, we explored Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows for interactive Python programming and data analysis. We learned how to create new notebooks, import and use the various features of the platform.

### Day 2 - Data Exploration, Selection, Indexing, Grouping, and Aggregation

Day two was focused on data exploration. We learned to:

- Select specific data from datasets
- Index data for easier access and manipulation
- Group and aggregate data to derive meaningful insights
  We extensively used Python libraries such as pandas to perform these tasks efficiently.

### Day 3 - Data Cleaning

On the third day, we dedicated our time to data cleaning, an essential step for accurate analysis and predictions. We learned to:

- Handle missing data
- Remove duplicates
- Correct inconsistent data entries
- Normalize data to ensure consistency and ease of use

### Day 4 - Introduction to Data Visualization

The fourth day introduced us to the world of data visualization. We explored:

- Different types of plots and charts to represent data visually
- Libraries like matplotlib and seaborn for creating these visualizations
- Customizing visualizations to enhance their informativeness and aesthetic appeal
